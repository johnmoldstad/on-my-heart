	<aside>These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.<br /><span>&ndash; Deuteronomy 6:6-9</span>

	<aside> Let every one know therefore, that it is his duty...to bring up his children above all things in the fear and knowledge of God.<br /><span>&ndash; Martin Luther</span>
